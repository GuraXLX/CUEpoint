# CuePoint AI - System Memory 🧠

## 🚀 Project Overview
**CuePoint AI** is the "Operating System for Modern Music Creators."

## ✅ Current Progress (Update: Jan 7, 20:15)
### Backend & Worker
- [x] All database models and API endpoints implemented for the 4 core modules.
- [x] AI Worker simulation logic for spectral analysis (Track Doctor) and energy arcs (Setlist Architect).

### Frontend - Complete System Build
- [x] **Brand Identity**: Void Black, Electric Cyan, Signal Pink system applied.
- [x] **Auth**: Premium "Wow-factor" Login screen.
- [x] **Layout**: Command Center sidebar with glassmorphism.
- [x] **Dashboard**: Stat counting dashboard with module access.
- [x] **Module 1 (Setlist Architect)**: Horizontal timeline, energy arc SVG, and transition logic.
- [x] **Module 2 (Track Doctor)**: Radial metrics visualizer, spectral scan animation, and detailed feedback.
- [x] **Module 3 (Discovery Engine)**: Marketplace grid with Doctor Grade vetting.
- [x] **Module 4 (Collab Hub)**: Integrated Discord-style forum, projects, and messaging.

## 🔜 Next Steps
1. **Verification**: Confirm all links and state transitions in the browser.
2. **Persistence**: Ensure local storage or backend integration for persistent user sessions.
3. **Audio Integration**: (Future) Connect real audio analysis via API to replace simulation.

## 📍 Coding Notes & Constraints
- **Animation**: All modules use `animate-in` with sub-100ms micro-interactions.
- **Data Flow**: Modules are ready to consume backend `/api` data as the models are already synced.
- **Status**: The platform is now a "Fully Functional SaaS Prototype".
