# CuePoint AI - System Memory 🧠

## 🚀 Project Overview
**CuePoint AI** is the "Operating System for Modern Music Creators."

## ✅ Current Progress (Update: Jan 7, 20:25)
### Backend & Worker
- [x] Full API and Simulation logic implemented.
- [x] Celery tasks for Track Doctor and Setlist Architect active.

### Frontend - Complete System Build
- [x] **Consolidated Styles**: All UI changes, animations, and brand utilities centralized in `index.css`.
- [x] **Activation Sequence Auth**: Premium Login and Signup screens with generative backgrounds, floating inputs, and glassmorphism pods.
- [x] **Layout**: Command Center sidebar layout with glassmorphism and refined Logo component.
- [x] **Module 1 (Setlist Architect)**: Horizontal timeline, energy arc SVG, and transition logic.
- [x] **Module 2 (Track Doctor)**: Radial metrics visualizer, spectral scan animation, and detailed feedback.
- [x] **Module 3 (Discovery Engine)**: Marketplace grid with Doctor Grade vetting.
- [x] **Module 4 (Collab Hub)**: Integrated Discord-style forum, projects, and messaging.

### Persistence & Git
- [x] **Git Sync**: All 19 files committed and pushed.
- [x] **Continuous Memory**: `system_memory.md` updated and staged for frequent sync.

## 🔜 Next Steps
1. **Frontend: Signup Link**: Ensure the signup route is active in `App.tsx`.
2. **State Management**: Implement global auth state to manage the "Activation" flow.

## 📍 Coding Notes & Constraints
- **Universal CSS**: Use `index.css` for all shared brand tokens.
- **Wow Factor**: Staggered fades and the "Initial Load" animation are non-negotiable.
